An open-source project to create a map of safe spaces for people in need.

## Deploy

We provide docker images to deploy SafeHaven. You can find the releases in the 
[packages view of the SafeHavenMaps organisation](https://github.com/SafeHavenMaps/safehaven/pkgs/container/safehaven).

### Pre-requisites

- A PostgreSQL server with PostGIS

### Prepare the database

Create a database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE safehaven;
```

SafeHaven leverages PostgreSQL's full text search capabilities. You can help the indexer by setting a locale on the database:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE safehaven SET default_text_search_config = 'pg_catalog.french';
```

## Configure

SafeHaven is initialized with a default user named `admin` with a random password, which can be retrieved from backend logs.

The administration panel will provide you with the ability to create new users and manage the application. A wiki will be available soon to help you with the configuration.

### Start the docker container:

```bash
docker run -d \ 
  -e SAFEHAVEN_DATABASE__URL="postgresql://user:password@host/safehaven" \  # Set the database path
  -e SAFEHAVEN_DATABASE__POOL_SIZE="5" \                                    # Set the number of connections to the database
  -e SAFEHAVEN_SECURE_COOKIE="true" \                                       # Activate if you have a reverse proxy with HTTPS.
  -e SAFEHAVEN_TOKEN_SECRET="SecretForValidatingAngSigningTokens" \         # Set a secret that will be used to sign sessions
  ghcr.io/safehavenmaps/safehaven:latest                                    # Change latest to the latest version, check the releases
```
